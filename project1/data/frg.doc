Dear Students,
  The data in frg.dat are stored by y-scan lines.  
There are 51 columns of 21 numbers each.  This is
a digitized set of map data from a small city in 
Germany.  The data values are real.  The following
info has been coded on the elevation data:

   xxx.tr   t=1 implies orchards (4 meters high)
            t=2 implies buildings (up to 10 meters high)
            t=3 implies trees (up to 20 meters high)
            r=1 implies a road

In review there are 51X21=1071 values.


     1,21 2,21  ....  51,21
       ...      ....   ...
     1,2  2,2   ....  51,2
     1,1  2,1   ....  51,1

Here is pseudocode for reading the data:

     for i= 1 to 51 do
       for j= 1 to 21 do
          read z(i,j)
       endfor
     endfor

Best wishes, Hue
