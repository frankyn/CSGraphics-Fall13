Dear Students,

Unfortunately, the data in wsmr.dat are stored by rows
not columns.  Sorry about that.  There 121X121 values.
The SouthWest corner is 1,1 and the NorthEast corner is 
121,121.

The spacing is 100 meters in both in x and y.
The area covered is 12000 by 12000 square meters.

The mountains lie in the South and West.  The Missile-range
is in the SouthEast.  

pseudo-code for reading wsmr.doc

  for j=1 to 121
    for i=1 to 121
       read( z(i,j))
    endi
  endj

Note if you use wsmrnew.dat it is 301 by 301 and has a header row....
